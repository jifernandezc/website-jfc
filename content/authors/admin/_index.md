I am a research assistant and administrative staff at the Centre of Economics and Regional Policy of the Adolfo Ibáñez University. My research interests include studying labour markets and their outputs at individual and local level and predictive models for public policies. My current work is related to the gender wage gaps in Latin America. Moreover, I am design and programming `mRio` an R package to make and multi-regionalized input-output tables.
